        text: "The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted online retail in India, accelerating growth and increasing market penetration. As of 2021, India had the third-largest shopper base globally, with approximately 180-190 million online shoppers. It is projected to surpass the US and become the second-largest shopper base within the next one to two years. In 2021, India's e-retail market reached approximately $40 billion and is expected to reach $50 billion in 2022. The country's strong fundamentals, including a large online consumer base and retail market (third largest globally), make it an attractive e-retail market. With a smartphone penetration rate of 36% (compared to 63% in China and 76% in the US) and an affluence level of around $2,000 per capita (compared to approximately $12,000 in China and $69,000 in the US), India has significant potential for sustained growth, especially considering the already low data prices. The rising affluence among consumers will drive increased consumption and spending per shopper. While the current inflationary environment may pose short-term challenges, the long-term growth of the e-retail market in India is supported by structural drivers. It is estimated that by 2027, India's e-retail market will reach $150-$170 billion, with an annual growth rate of 25%-30% and a doubling of market penetration to 9%-10% over the next five years. The category mix of online purchases is also expected to change. While mobile phones, electronics, and appliances have traditionally dominated the e-retail market, categories such as fashion, general merchandise (including personal care), and grocery have higher potential for growth due to their relatively low penetration compared to mature markets. By 2027, these categories are projected to account for around two-thirds of the e-retail market.",

        text: "A significant portion of the shoppers (2021-22), about 60%, are from tier-3 or smaller cities. Gen Z (18-25 years of age) represents an important cohort of new shoppers and will play a critical role in the future. Fashion is the primary category for these new shoppers, and they typically start with entry-level price points. Simultaneously, the existing shopper base is maturing, as indicated by increased engagement on retail platforms. The percentage of daily active users to monthly active users has risen to over 25% in 2021, compared to 18%-20% in 2019. Consumers now spend 20% more time per month on retail platforms than the previous year.The growth of e-retail in India has also led to significant developments in the supplier and logistics ecosystem. The online seller base in India has grown by 35% annually over the past year, with around 40% of new sellers coming from tier-2 or smaller cities. Additionally, there has been a decline in the cost per shipment, with a year-over-year reduction of 7%-9% from 2018 to 2021. E-retail is now accessible in 99% of India's pin codes, thanks to the expansion of the logistics network. The Indian government is playing a crucial role in promoting e-retail through initiatives like the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), which aims to create an interoperable network for digital commerce similar to the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) network for payments. If successfully executed, ONDC could further boost the Indian e-retail ecosystem.",
